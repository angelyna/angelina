        <h1>Deploy your app on HEROKU with JawsDB MySQL in 5 Steps</h1>
	    <p>
		    The code is slightly different if your app is coded with sequelize,</p>
	            <p>and this is not discussed in this post.

                <p>Your app runs beautifully in your local browser! You managed to successfully deploy it on Heroku! And
                    just when you hit the 'Open app' button ... the browser thinks ... and states --> Application Error !!!</p>
                <br>
                     <div id="pic"> <img class="card-img-top" src="../img/error_screen.png" alt="pic1">
                      </div>
      
		<br>
                <p>Oh no, no, no!!! Type ‘heroku logs –tail’ in your terminal and it rains with errors! What on earth is this???
                    Simply put, the app runs perfectly fine on your localhost at your defined port (eg. 3000), but fails to
                    run on Heroku. Why? Because Heroku runs your node.js app ‘differently’ than your local machine. Let’s
                    untangle these errors in 5 steps, in a beginner’s guide fashion!
                    <p>
	<br>
    <strong>STEP 1: Update your Heroku account with your credit card information.</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Heroku collects this info to preclude potential inappropriate user behavior.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Open Heroku Account Settings in your Heroku dashboard browser.
    </li>
    <li>
	Click on 'Manage Account', then select 'Billing', and then 'Billing Information'.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fill in the info and save to update your account with this information.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<div id="pic"> <img class="card-img-top" src="../img/creditcard_screen.png" alt="pic2">
</div>
<br>
<br>		   
<p>
    <strong>STEP 2: Choose a name for your app and then create it in Heroku.</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>
        On your terminal type the following command: heroku create your_app_name.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not use quotation marks when specifying your app name.
    </li>
	<li>
    Refresh Heroku browser to see the app name you just created. Alternatively you can create your app name directly in the browser
    on Heroky.
	</li>
    <li>
        Fill in the info and save to update your account with this information.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>
    <strong>STEP 3: Obtain JawsDB MySQL settings for your app.</strong>
</p>
<hr>	
<ul>
    <li>
        In Heroku browser, select your_app_name tab. Then click on Resources tab. And now click on 'Find more add_ons' tab. You should be here:
<br>
<div id="pic"> <img class="heroku add ons" src="../img/add_ons.png" alt="pic3">              
<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        Scroll down the page to find JawsDB MySQL tab – the blue shark icon – and click on it to open the JawsDB MySQL page.
    </li>
    <li>
    Once you are on the JawsDB MySQL page, scroll down to find the 'Plans and Pricing' area and select 'Kitefin Shared free'.
    This is the first option on their list and it is free. Carefully select it. It opens the plan details and together with
    it, the Install JawsDB MySQL button: 'Heroku Install_Jaws_DB.'
    </li>
    <li>
        Install it. When completed, Heroku will provide you with the connection settings for JawsDB MySQL. You need these settings
        to configure the connection in your local MySQLWorkbench, to ultimately be able to connect and perform CRUD operations
        in your app database through Heroku.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<div id="pic"> <img class="card-img-top" src="../img/config1.png" alt="pic4.1">              
<br>
<div id="pic"> <img class="card-img-top" src="../img/config2.png" alt="pic4.2">  
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>STEP 4: Create a MySQLWorkbench connection. Configure it with your Heroku JawsDBMySQL settings.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>
In your local machine, open MySQL Workbench to create a new connection. In the'Set Up a New Connection' window fill in your app Heroku settings provided:			
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Fill in Connection name: enter your choice
	</li>
	<li>
	Connection Type: enter Standard TCP/IP
	</li>
	<li>
	Hostname: enter the hostname provided by JawsDB MySQL, it ends in amazonaws.com
	</li>
	<li>
	PORT: enter 3306 (the MySQLWorkbench PORT)
	</li>
	<li>
	Username: enter the username provided by JawsDB MySQL
	</li>
	<li>
	Default Schema: enter the Database name provided by JawsDB MySQL
	</li>
	<li>
	PORT: enter 3306 (the MySQLWorkbench PORT)
	</li>
</ul>
<br>				
<div id="pic"> <img class="card-img-top" src="../img/herokuConnection.png" alt="pic5">  
<br>
<br>			       
<p>If your MySQL Workbench configuration screen includes a field requesting the Connection String, fill it in. The Connection String is provided by Heroku. Afterwards, open this connection and create your first query.
Inside it create the database table, and add in some data (INSERT INTO TABLE ... you know it!).
Run your query. After you successfully created it - with no errors - you can close MySQL Workbench.
In the next step you have to update your app with the newly created config.<p/>

<p><strong>STEP 5: Update your app connections configuartion with the JawsDB MySQL settings.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>
This step has to be adapted to your app structure. Basicaly two files have to be updated: connection.js and server.js.</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>
Open your connection.js file (or your app connection configuration file, however you named it) and add the code to
define the Heroku connection with your specific JawsDB url environment. 
	</li>
	<li>
Then update the server connection file (or your app server configuration file, however you namedit). 
	</li>
	<li>
Your updates should look like these:
	</li>
</P>			       
			       
<br>
<ul>
	<li>
	Connection configuration
<div id="pic"> <img class="card-img-top" src="../img/connection.png" alt="pic6">  
	</li>
	<li>
	Server configuration
<div id="pic"> <img class="card-img-top" src="../img/server.png" alt="pic7">  
	</li>
</ul>
<br>  
<p>Complete these 5 steps. Deploy your app to Heroku. Open your app. Now it runs successfully! Congratulations, you made it!</p>
